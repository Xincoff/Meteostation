# Meteostation
A weather station project that calculates temperature, humidity, light intensity, human presence, and can respond to environmental changes

The weather station calculates the temperature and humidity and tells you what to do with the data (raise or lower it). It also measures the light intensity and can "fall asleep" if the room is dark and there are no people. The station will "fall asleep" if there is no one in the room or if the person is sleeping to conserve energy. It has a built-in character that reacts to changes in the environment. The character's emotions include joy, yawning, sleeping, looking around, boredom, and more.
